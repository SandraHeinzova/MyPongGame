# MyPongGame

** To play MyPongGame on your computer, you just need to download all of the files! **

This project is a part of The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy.

I took some hints from Angela, but the code itself is mostly the result of my own work.

It drastically improved my understanding of OOP.

Have fun!
